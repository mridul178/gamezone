README for Gamezone Website

1.Website Overview:
 I created a gaming-themed website called "Gamezone" to provide users with information about popular games, a gallery of gameplay images, and a contact form for feedback. The website includes four interconnected pages: Home, Games, Gallery, and Contact. Each page is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing.

2.Files and Their Purpose:

-index.html: The main homepage with an "About Us" section and navigation to other pages.
-games.html: Displays a table listing the top 5 games with details, clickable images, and an -ordered list of game features.
-gallery.html: A grid-based gallery of gameplay images with captions.
-contact.html: A contact form for users to provide feedback, featuring inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons, and a reset/submit button.
-style.css: An external stylesheet for consistent design and layout across all pages.

3.Features Implemented:

-Navigation: Buttons on every page for smooth navigation (Home, Games, Gallery, Contact).
-Hyperlinks: Links to official game websites and social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Email).
-Images: Multiple images used on all pages, including GIFs, gallery images, and game icons.
-Lists: Ordered and unordered lists for game details on the Games page.
-Table: A two-column table on the Games page showing game rankings, details, and clickable images.
-Form: A contact form on the Contact page with essential components like input fields, dropdowns, radio buttons, textarea, and buttons.

4. Stylesheet Usage:

  -External CSS (style.css):
      Used for global styles such as the background color, font styling, button designs, table layout, and grid systems.

  -Internal CSS (contact.html and gallery.html):
    On the Contact page: Internal CSS styles the form container, input fields, and buttons.
    On the Gallery page: Internal CSS adjusts the gallery layout and captions.

  -Inline CSS (index.html and games.html):
    -On the Home page: The banner GIF uses inline CSS for width, height, and centering.
    -On the Games page: Specific styles for table images are applied inline, such as width and         border radius.

5.Code Highlights:

I used semantic HTML tags like <header>, <main>, <nav>, and <footer> for a well-structured and accessible layout.
Accessibility features, such as alt attributes for all images and aria-label for form elements, are implemented.


6.Testing:

I tested the website on multiple browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, to ensure consistent functionality and appearance.
